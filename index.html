    <p>Though your documentation should take a reader-centered approach, the writing process is for <i>you</i>. If you struggle through explaining a piece of your software in writing, there is probably a better way to build that functionality. Elegant implementations lead to elegant explanations.</p>
    <p>Be honest about things that are wonky/don't make total sense. Reassures readers they're following correctly / opens chance for contributions.</p>
    <p>When and how to use images/screen shots vs. code vs. plain writing.</p>
    <p>Diversify your explanations, everybody learns/interprets things differently.</p>
    <h3>Balance Your Context</h3>
    <h4>Low-context vs. high-context cultures</h4>
    <p>Low-context cultures assume readers are bringing little context to their reading. These cultures tend to provide a lot of detail in communications. High-context cultures assume the reader already has sufficient context and prior knowledge, making their communications much more concise.</p>
    <p>When communicating with different cultures, balancing context is key.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Intro:</b> who, what, where, when, why, wokka wokka</li>
        <li><b>Roles:</b> writer, audience</li>
        <li><b>What to focus on:</b> concise yet comprehensive, accurate & honest, accessible/easy to search/skim, consistency,  design/presentation</li>
        <li><b>Examples:</b> docs that succeed/fail at the above & why, anatomy of a README</li>
        <li><b>Audience:</b> who are these people and what the hell do they want from you? (multiple audiences, skill levels)</li>
        <li><b>Writing:</b> flow/order, effective sentence structures, appropriate headings
        <li><b>Drafting:</b> testing (modularity) & rewriting your docs, editing & proof-reading</li>
        <li><b>Collaboration:</b> handling multiple writers on the same doc/different pieces of docs</li>
        <li><b>Persuasion/Recommendations:</b> sometimesss ya need ta outline an argument for a particular tech stack/pattern</li>
        <li><b>Technical Speaking:</b> because we do this too and sometimes not so well</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Understanding Your Readers</h3>
    <p>Establishing credibility is highly dependent on how well you understand your readers. Writing documentation is all about anticipating how and why people will want to use your software. The better you can anticipate the needs of your readers, the more thorough and accessible your documentation will be.</p>
    <p>When working on a project for an extended amount of time, you become an expert on its inner-workings. The more familiar you are with software, the more difficult it becomes to document the simpler use-cases. Writing your documentation as you build will help you maintain your hindsight, and prevent you from neglecting a portion of your audience.</p>

    <h3>Get To The Bottom Line</h3>
    <h4>Direct vs. indirect approaches</h4>
    <p>What's the bottom line our reader's are looking for and how do I help them find it?</p>

    <h3>Readers respond moment-to-moment</h3>
    <p>When you're reading a book and come across a funny sentence, you don't wait until you've finished the entire book to laugh at it. Readers react to content as it's presented.
