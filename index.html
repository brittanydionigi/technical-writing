    <p>Boop boop: if you can't explain it, there's probably any easier technical solution to the problem</p>
    <p>Be honest about things that are wonky/don't make total sense. Reassures readers they're following correctly / opens chance for contributions.</p>
    <p>When and how to use images/screen shots vs. code vs. plain writing.</p>
    <p>Diversify your explanations, everybody learns/interprets things differently.</p>
    <h3>Balance Your Context</h3>
    <h4>Low-context vs. high-context cultures</h4>
    <p>Low-context cultures assume readers are bringing little context to their reading. These cultures tend to provide a lot of detail in communications. High-context cultures assume the reader already has sufficient context and prior knowledge, making their communications much more concise.</p>
    <p>When communicating with different cultures, balancing context is key.</p>
